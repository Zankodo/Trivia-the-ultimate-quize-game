This code snippet is a JavaScript code that fetches quiz questions from an external API and displays them on a web page. It also handles user interaction with the quiz, including answering questions, keeping track of scores, and showing the result.

The first few lines of the code retrieve the difficulty level and category of the quiz from the local storage and assign a number of questions to fetch based on the difficulty level. The get() function is an asynchronous function that fetches questions from the Open Trivia API using the specified category, difficulty level, and the number of questions to fetch.

The code also defines several event listeners to handle user interactions with the quiz, including starting the quiz, moving to the next question, and restarting or quitting the quiz.

The showQuestions(index) function displays the quiz question and options on the web page. It takes an index parameter that represents the current question number and uses it to retrieve the appropriate question and options from the questions array. The function also adds event listeners to each option to handle user clicks.

The optionSelected(answer) function is called when the user selects an answer option. It compares the user's answer with the correct answer and displays a tick or cross icon based on whether the user's answer is correct or incorrect. The function also updates the user's score and moves to the next question after a specified time interval.

Finally, the showResult() function displays the user's final score and offers the user the option to restart or quit the quiz.
